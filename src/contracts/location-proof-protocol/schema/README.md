# Location Proof Protocol: Core Data Model v0.1

## Core Layer

The core layer of the Location Proof Protocol includes a standard data model. v0.1 of the data model is described in this document. The
current working schema is deployed on Ethereum Sepolia testnet, UID `0xd928da08c10180b639e31c5f46acf4ea011d88ec7ac44bd95f32385e2d66032b`

| Media Type               | A unique string referring to the media to be included in a `bytes` field, Media Data. This pattern is similar to OpenGraph Protocolâ€™s `type` definition.                                                | `mediaType`      | `string[]` | Defined from a set of supported media types, to be stored in the @/media directory                               |
| Media Data               | A `bytes` field allowing the attachment of arbitrary data to a location proof. This data is intended to be irrelevant to the location proof and not required/utilized in the proof recipe verification. | `mediaData`      | `bytes[]`  | Specified in media type definition                                                                               |

Note that this design supports location proofs that include multiple recipe types / recipe payloads and media type / media data.
