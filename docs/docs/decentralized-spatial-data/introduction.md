# Introduction

Most of the recent work on decentralized geospatial data storage and access technologies have been done by our friends over at the EASIER Data Initiative, based at the University of Maryland.

You can find extensive information on their work [here](https://easierdata.org/); if you'd like to be connected, reach out on Telegram.
