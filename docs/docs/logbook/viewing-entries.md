# Viewing Entries

To view a single log entry, load the Log Entry Details page â€” the URLs are formatted as follows:

`https://logbook.astral.global/attestation/<UID>`

where the UID is the 64-digit hex string identifying the attestation on EAS.

This will load a page displaying a map with a marker showing where the entry is positioned, the date and time, the memo and media, along
with details like the account that created the entry, plus a link to the attestation on EASscan.
