# Farcaster Frames (soon ðŸ˜‰)

We're working on extending these pages into Farcaster Frames, so you can share geotagged content as an interactive, embedded frame in your
Farcaster feed.

Our first frame will be the Log Entry Details page â€”Â we're working on a frame that shows the photos attached to an entry, along with a map
of where the entry is located.

If you want to help us build these Farcaster Frames, [reach out](./contributing.md)!
