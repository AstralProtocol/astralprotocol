# Multi-entry Views (in development)

Viewing one log entry is valuable, but the real power of the Logbook lies with our multi-entry dashboards. We're actively working on these
features.

Multi-entry views display collections of log entries overlaid on a map. This interface can give you:

- a bird's-eye view of all of the entries you've recorded (i.e. address view)
- entries recorded in a particular area over a particular timeframe (location view)
- entries from a curated list of addresses, say of friends or particular token holders (group view)
- entries that share a hashtag or work in the string memo (hashtag / topic view)

This provides a location-based discovery tool to see what people are posting about places that are relevant to you.

Under the hood, this page is powered by GraphQL, and is only limited by the creativity of the GraphQL queries we can think up. Multi-entry
views showcase the power of composability and user-owned identity in the onchain geospatial world.
