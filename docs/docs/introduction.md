# Introduction

<img src="/img/astral-logo.png" alt="Astral" width="250" />

Astral is an open source R+D studio building software for the decentralized geospatial web. Our pillars are:

- **Decentralized location proofs**
- **Onchain GIS**
- **Decentralized spatial data storage**.

We're currently sponsoring the [Funding the Commons & Earth Commons Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/ftc-2024/detail). We want
builders to experiment with our new [Location Proof Protocol](./location-proof-protocol), extend the [Astral Logbook](./logbook) client
dapp, use the tools we’ve built to store and query [geospatial data on IPFS](./decentralized-spatial-data), or build with any of the open
source projects we’ve worked on.

Our emphasis is on projects focused on novel, **location-based public goods funding ideas** and **decentralized tools for climate action**,
but if you have another idea — social, gaming, anything — reach out, we’d love to support.
