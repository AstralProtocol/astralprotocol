# EAS Schema

## Location Proof Protocol: Core Schema v0.1 (Sepolia Testnet)

The core layer of the Location Proof Protocol includes a standard data model. v0.1 of the data model is described in this document. The
current working schema is deployed on:

| Proof Recipe Payload     | Encoded data specific to the proof recipe, which could include encrypted location data, a zero-knowledge proof, or references to other verification data.                                                                   | `recipePayload`  | `bytes[]`  | Specified in recipe definition                                                                                   |
| Media Type               | A unique string referring to the media to be included in a `bytes` field, Media Data. This pattern is similar to OpenGraph Protocolâ€™s `type` definition.                                                                    | `mediaType`      | `string[]` | Defined from a set of supported media types, to be stored in the @/media directory                               |
| Media Data               | A `string` field allowing the attachment of arbitrary data to a location proof, referenced by CID.

Raw schema:

`uint256 eventTimestamp,string srs,string locationType,string location,string[] recipeType,bytes[] recipePayload,string[] mediaType,string[] mediaData,string memo`

Note that this design supports location proofs that include multiple recipe types / recipe payloads and media type / media data.
