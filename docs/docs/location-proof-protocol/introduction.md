# Introduction

The Location Proof Protocol aims to address the challenge of proving location on the decentralized web in a flexible, yet standardized way.

Given the diverse requirements and approaches for location proofs, our goal is to support innovation across a wide range of proof strategies
while providing a standard data model for creating and verifying these proofs.

This section of the monorepo currently contains:

- Specifications of the core [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) schema](./eas-schema.md) for the protocol
- Details on how to create location proofs using different [location types](./location-types.md)
- A framework (in development) for building ["recipes"](./strategies-recipes.md) that allow for many different strategies for proving
  location to be added (WIP)
- Information on attaching differet types of [media](./media-types.md) to location proofs (WIP)
